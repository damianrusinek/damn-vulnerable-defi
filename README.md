## Write-ups and lessons learned (added by @drdr_zz)

This is a fork of the original repo, where I present the write-ups and lessons learned from the vulnerable contracts. Each challenge has a write-up (links below), an exploit (in the testcase file) and some have attacker contracts (in [this directory](contracts/attacker-contracts)). 

Here is the list of write-ups for all challenges:

1. [Unstoppable](write-ups/Unstoppable.md)
2. [Naive Receiver](write-ups/NaiveReceiver.md)
3. [Truster](write-ups/Truster.md)
4. [Side Entrance](write-ups/Side-Entrance.md)
5. [The Rewarder](write-ups/TheRewarder.md)
6. [Selfie](write-ups/Selfie.md)
7. [Compromised](write-ups/Compromised.md)
8. [Puppet](write-ups/Puppet.md)

## DeFI category added to SCSVS (added by @drdr_zz)

I have added new category to [Smart Contracts Security Verification](https://github.com/securing/SCSVS) Standard called *Decentralized Finance* basing on the challenges and recent hacks in #DeFi. 

It contains the security requirements specific to the mechanisms used by the #DeFi applications. 

Check out the list of **new requirements**!
