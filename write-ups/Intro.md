# TL;DR:

I have solved all of the Damn Vulnerable #DeFi challenges by OpenZeppelin. Here I present the write-ups and lessons learned from the vulnerable contracts.

Besides, I have added new category to [Smart Contracts Security Verification](https://github.com/securing/SCSVS) Standard called *Decentralized Finance (DeFi)* basing on the challenges and recent hacks. Check this out!

# Damn Vulnerable #DEFI

A couple of weeks ago OpenZeppelin team (thanks @tinchoabbate !) has created a set of vulnerable smart contracts that implement some constructions used by #DeFi  (e.g. flash loans, governance, on-chain oracles, lending pools). 

Here is the list of write-ups for all challenges:

1. [Unstoppable](...)
2. [Naive Receiver](...)
3. [Truster](..)
4. [Side Entrance](..)
5. [The Rewarder](..)
6. [Selfie](..)
7. [Compromised](..)
8. [Puppet](..)

# New category in #SCSVS

Based on the challenges and recent hacks in #DeFi I have started a new category in [Smart Contract Security Verification Standard](...) called *Decentralized Finance (DeFi)*.

It contains the security requirements specific to the mechanisms used by the DeFi applications. 

Check out the list of [new requirements](...)!





# Outro

I hope these write-ups and some lessons will be helpful :) 

Remember to check out [SCSVS](...) with new #DeFi requirements. If you want to stay tuned follow me on Twitter (@drdr_zz).
